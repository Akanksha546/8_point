Optimizing  the 8-Point Algorithm for Robust Feature Matching in Noisy Environments
Optimizing the 8-point algorithm for robust feature matching in noisy environments is a critical task in computer vision, especially in applications such as stereo vision, structure-from-motion, and robotics.

Observations:

Noise Reduction with Gaussian Blur:
Applying Gaussian blur at the beginning is a smart choice for suppressing noise and stabilizing feature detection.

Feature Detection and Description:
ORB is a good choice for fast, efficient, and rotation-invariant keypoint detection and description.

Feature Matching:
The BFMatcher with crossCheck=True ensures symmetric matching, improving the quality of matches.

Fundamental Matrix Estimation:
Using cv2.FM_8POINT aligns with the 8-Point Algorithm for computing the fundamental matrix, which is essential for epipolar geometry.

Visualization:
Drawing matches before and after RANSAC is an excellent way to visualize how outliers are filtered.
